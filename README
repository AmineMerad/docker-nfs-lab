NFS Docker Project
This project sets up an NFS server and client using Docker containers, demonstrating basic file sharing and security with TCP Wrappers.
Prerequisites

Docker and Docker Compose installed
Basic knowledge of Docker and NFS

Setup

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo


Build and start the containers:docker-compose up --build



Testing

Access the client container:docker exec -it nfs-client bash


Mount the NFS share:mkdir /mnt/partage
mount 192.168.100.2:/home/partage /mnt/partage


Test file operations:
Create a file: echo "Hello from client" > /mnt/partage/test.txt
Verify on server: docker exec -it nfs-server bash and cat /home/partage/test.txt


Check mounts:mount | grep nfs



Notes

Ensure the subnet in docker-compose.yml doesnâ€™t conflict with your network.
Adjust IP addresses if needed.
